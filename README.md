Hello everyone!

In this project, I have used an publc api and news website.
the output of this project is a csv file, containing date, headlines of the date and sock price of a particular company.
to avoid any copyright problem, I have deleted the news website and api that I have used, but the algorithm should work with a few modification!

hope you find this useful!
